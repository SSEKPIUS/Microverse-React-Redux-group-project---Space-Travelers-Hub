<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

> Questions new developers would ask when they decide to use this project.

- **What is front-end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript**
  - The front end refers to the parts of the application that users (also known as "clients") interact with directly
  - As a front-end dev, you'll implement these tasks primarily using HTML to define the structure of web pages, CSS to add styling, and JavaScript to add interactivity.

- **What is back-end and Full stack**
  - The back end refers to the parts of the application that run behind the scenes and aren't presented directly to the user/client.
  - The back end typically includes a web server which handles HTTP connections received from the front-end client (usually a web browser)
  - Full stack simply includes both the front end AND back end!
